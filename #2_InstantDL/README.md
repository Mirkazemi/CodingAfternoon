InstantDL is a deep learning pipeline package for image processing. The package was presented by Dominik Waibel on March 19, 2021. 

Abstract: We have developed InstantDL, a deep learning pipeline for four common image processing tasks: semantic segmentation, 
instance segmentation, pixel-wise regression and classification. InstantDL enables researchers with a basic computational background 
to apply debugged and benchmarked state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to their own data with minimal effort. To make the pipeline 
robust, we have automated and standardized workflows and extensively tested it in different scenarios. Moreover, it allows assessing the 
uncertainty of predictions. We have benchmarked InstantDL on seven publicly available datasets achieving competitive performance without 
any parameter tuning. For customization of the pipeline to specific tasks, all code is easily accessible and well documented.
